# Python
## Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Data Analysis Project

## Project Description

Data was collected from eBay to obtain valuable information for a business intelligence analysis conducted for a fictitious company. 

* **Web Scraping**

The data was gathered using Python and the Beautiful Soup library. It comprises the following columns: Title, Price_sold, Shipping_cost, Item_location, Item_seller, and Link.

* **Data Cleaning**

The data underwent a thorough cleaning process, which involved the following steps:

1. Eliminating irrelevant columns and rows from the dataset.
2. Splitting certain columns into multiple colunms to enhance analysis.
3. Adjusting column data types for better alignment with the data's nature.
4. Addressing and handling missing values (null values) appropriately.
5. Removing any undesirable characters from specific columns.
6. Completing incomplete rows by filling in the correct values.

* **Data Analysis**

The data was subjected to exploratory analysis to uncover its statistical characteristics, and this process led to further investigation of the following questions;

* Who are the highest performing sellers?
* What are the top selling books?
* What is the average price of items sold?
* How many unique item locations are there?
* Distribution of Books by Location.
* How many books are the price above the average price.
* The shipping types by the sellers and their percentage.
* Distribution of seller ratings.
* How many sellers has a rating above average.
* What are the average price of items within each location?
* Is there a relationship between seller feedback and seller rating percentage?
* Is there correlations between "Price_sold" and "Seller_Rating%"?
